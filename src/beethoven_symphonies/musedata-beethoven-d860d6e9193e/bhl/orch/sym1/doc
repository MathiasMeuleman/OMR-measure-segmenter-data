Note: The current version of .mpg files in the outputs/score library 
      are generated from the group &dEskore&d@.   I think the files in 
      outputs/score.old are generated from the group &dEscore&d@.  Among 
      the differences between these full scores are that staves 
      carring two instruments in the current version (&dEskore&d@) have 
      both parts represented all of the time, even when one or both 
      are resting.
