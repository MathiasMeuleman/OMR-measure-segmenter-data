INDEX   Ludwig van Beethoven 
 Format:    (version 12/06/05) 

   The first line in the index file contains the word INDEX 
   starting in column 1.  This word is followed by some space 
   and then the name of the composer.  All lines following the 
   first line, up to the first index entry are a description of 
   the format of the index (plus other other comments which 
   might be added from time to time). 

   All index entries start in column 1.  Works are listed by 
   a shortened version of their complete file name (path).  
   &dEEach work MUST have a unique name&d@.  In some cases, e.g., 
   Bach BWV numbers, the name can be the work name itself; 
   in other cases, e.g. Corelli, the name may need to include 
   additional path information, e.g., OP3/01.  (01 by itself 
   is not sufficient; there is also an OP6/01).  An equals 
   sign ("=") in column 1 signifies a comment.  

   Following each entry in the index are two or more data lines 
   starting in colmun 2 and containing the following information: 

     1.  Formal title of the work 
     1a. [alternate name] 
     1b. [alternate name] 
            etc.  
         Alternate names must be in square parentheses; i.e., a          
         square parenthesis in column-2 signifies an alternate name.
         Alternate names are optional; there may be none.  

     2. Number of sources for the work 

     For each source, there will be listed the name of the 
     source file directory starting in column 2, followed 
     by other information starting in column 3.  Put another 
     way, the "source" is that part of the full path name 
     between the &dEcomposer&d@ and the &dEwork name&d@.  


       Source file name (starting in column 2) 

         1. Formal name of the source 
         2. Data stage flag: 0 = stage1 in progress 
                             1 = stage1 finished and/or stage2 in progress 
                             2 = stage2 finished and/or stage2 checking 
                                   in progress 
                             3 = stage2 checking finished and/or preparation
                                   of release files in progress. (e.g. adding
                                   tags, checking release files, etc.) 

                        Greater than 3, this number is a set of flags

         4. Number of movements in this work (in this source) 
         5. and up:  names of the files containing these movements 
              Following the file names can be any other information 
              which helps identify the movement.  In general, we will 
              not be releasing specific movements of works separately.  

       Source file name (etc.) 


   The last line in the index file contains the word "END" beginning
