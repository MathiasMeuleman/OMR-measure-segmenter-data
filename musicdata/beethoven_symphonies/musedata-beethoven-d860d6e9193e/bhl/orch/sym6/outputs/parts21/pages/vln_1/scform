VJ-1    = vertically justify proportionally to 2800 
VJ-2    = vertically justify proportionally to 2800; with x2 space between systems
VJ-3    = vertically justify proportionally to 2800; use only inter-system space
VJ-4(#,#,etc. ) = vertically justify to 2800; use only space below designated lines in system
VJ-5(#,#,etc. ) = vertically justify to 2800; use only space below designated lines on page  
  For VJ-4 and VJ-5, if a system or line is designated with a plus sign, it means "add space"
  below this line.  The amount of space (in 10ths of interline distance) is given in 
  square parentheses.  
VEX-# = vertically expand by adding specified distance (10ths of interline) between all lines
MTX(#[x],#[x],etc.)   = move text lines for these line numbers, amount in square parentheses
                          is expressed in 10ths of interline distance.  A positive number
                          moves the text line down.  
MFG(#[x],#[x],etc.)   = move figured harmony for these line numbers, amount in square
                          parentheses is expressed in 10ths of interline distance.  A
                          positive number moves the text line down.
